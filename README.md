### About the project

This project is a password manager that has been developed as a web application. The source code is available in the provided GitHub repository.

The main objective of this project is to provide users with a secure way to store and manage their passwords. With the increasing number of online services and the need to create strong and unique passwords for each of them, it has become increasingly challenging for users to remember all their passwords.

The application is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend. The frontend is developed using web technologies, specifically Angular, while the backend is built with Node.js.

In the frontend, the user interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. Users can create an account and log in to access their personal area. Once authenticated, they can securely add and store their passwords. The application utilizes encryption techniques to ensure that passwords are stored securely and protected. Additionally, there are features to generate random and strong passwords, helping users create secure passwords.

In the frontend, users can also edit or delete existing passwords, as well as view all their stored passwords.

In the backend, the server is built using Node.js. It handles user authentication, password storage and retrieval, as well as communication with the database. The project utilizes a database to securely store user information and their respective passwords. The backend also implements security features, such as protection against brute force attacks and prevention of code injection attacks.

Furthermore, the project includes automated tests to ensure the robustness and quality of the software. These tests cover both the frontend and the backend, verifying if all functionalities are working correctly.

In summary, the password manager project is a web application that offers users a secure way to store and manage their passwords. With a user-friendly interface, encryption features, and secure storage in the backend, the project aims to simplify the password management process and provide a reliable solution for users.
